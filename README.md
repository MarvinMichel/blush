A Dating app, created with Node.js and Express. Blush is the result of Project Tech's team assignment, commissioned by Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. We combined our individual use cases and developed a dating app. The user can sign in or create an account. The database is designed with Mongoose Models and Schemas and corresponds with mongoDB Atlas.

## How did we do it?

We worked together on the project using github.
We've created multiple branches from the cloned branch 'feed'. Eventually at the end we merged this into the master branch.

When someone was finished with a branch, he/she would create a pull request so that everything came together.

Also we made a lot of issues for every little feature we made, so we could easily see what everyone was doing. This so that we could create an overview for ourselves

## Thanks to
We want to thank everyone who helped us create this dating app. The teachers at Hogeschool van Amsterdam helped us very good with the project. Most of the things were very clear and despite of that the assignment was a bit hard, we liked doing it.
