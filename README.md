A Dating app, created with Node.js and Express. Blush is the result of Project Tech's team assignment, commissioned by Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. We combined our individual use cases and developed a dating app. The user can sign in or create an account. This is done with Passport.js for user authentication and Bcrypt for password hashing. The database is designed with Mongoose Models and Schemas and corresponds with mongoDB Atlas.

## How did we do it?

We worked together on the project using GitHub.
We've created multiple branches for features and bug fixes. Eventually at the end we merged these into the master branch.

When someone was finished with a branch, he/she would create a pull request so that everything came together. For more information about our workflow ommit merging and pushing, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/MarvinMichel/blush/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Also, we made a lot of issues for every little feature we made, so we could easily see what everyone was doing. This so that we could create an overview for ourselves
